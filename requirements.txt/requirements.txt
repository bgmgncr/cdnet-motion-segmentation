Functional Requirements

1.The system should process sequential video frames from the CDNet 2014 dataset.

2.The system should separate moving regions from static background regions using classical motion-based segmentation techniques.

3.The system should support multiple dataset categories to analyze different motion and illumination conditions.

4.The system should allow different algorithmic approaches to be applied to different dataset categories.

5.The system should apply post-processing techniques to improve the visual consistency of foreground masks.

6.The system should generate foreground masks and overlay images for visual analysis.

Non-Functional Requirements

1.The system should be flexible enough to experiment with different algorithms and parameters.

2.The system should support qualitative evaluation through visual inspection of outputs.

3.The system should be designed for educational purposes to analyze the strengths and limitations of classical approaches.
